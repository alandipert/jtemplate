Quickstart
==========

1.  Edit the default.properties file to your liking.  Make sure you don't have
    whitespace after values.

2.  Run 'ant init'.  This deletes .git and makes you a /src tree with a 
    Main class stub.

3.  You're cooking!

Ant targets you might use from here on out: 

+ 'all' or 'dist'
+ 'clean'
+ 'jar'
+ 'javadoc'
